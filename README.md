# MTgame21
This is my first web game made by myself, 21. It's a math game that nobody has ever made online so i decide to make one.
It has a very simple rule:
1.People takes turn adding a number but you can only add 1,2,3.
2.Whoevery says 21 looses.
3.Good luck

It's still an Alpha edition, if there is any error, contact me via gmail.
